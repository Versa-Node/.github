Welcome to the **Versa-Node** GitHub organisation — your central hub for all Versa-Node open-source repositories.  
We strive to build modular, scalable, and maintainable tools around the Versa-Node ecosystem.

## 🚀 Repositories  

Here are the main repos you’ll want to explore:

- [versanode-os](https://github.com/Versa-Node/versanode-os) — the core operating system layer for Versa-Node.  
- [versanode-os-usermods](https://github.com/Versa-Node/versanode-os-usermods) — user-mode modifications/extensions to the core OS.  
- [versanode-os-kmods](https://github.com/Versa-Node/versanode-os-kmods) — kernel modules for the Versa-Node OS.  
- [versanode-container-packages](https://github.com/Versa-Node/versanode-container-packages) — containerized packages and images used in Versa-Node deployments.  
- [versanode-cockpit-vncp-manager](https://github.com/Versa-Node/versanode-cockpit-vncp-manager) — the cockpit UI and management tool for VNCP within Versa-Node.  

## 🧩 Why Versa-Node  

Versa-Node is designed to provide a robust, flexible, and extensible platform that can be adapted across different use-cases — from embedded OS kernels, to container orchestration, to management UIs.  
We emphasise:  
- **Modularity** — separate repositories keep concerns clean.  
- **Open collaboration** — issues, pull requests, and community contributions are welcome.  
- **Scalability** — from kernel modules to container packages to full-blown UIs.  
- **Maintainability** — well-documented code, clear branching strategy, semantic versioning.

## 📦 How to get started  

1. Pick the repository that fits your goal (OS, usermods, kmods, containers, or cockpit manager).  
2. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Versa-Node/<repo-name>.git
   ```  
3. Refer to the repository’s own `README.md` for build, install, or usage instructions.  
4. When contributing:  
   - Fork the repository.  
   - Create a feature branch (`feat/...`) or bugfix branch (`bugfix/...`).  
   - Commit with clear messages.  
   - Submit a Pull Request and await review.

## 📖 Documentation & support  

Each repository contains its own dedicated documentation (see its `docs/` folder or its README).  
For general organisation-wide questions or to suggest new repos, file an issue in any of the repos and label it appropriately (e.g., `meta:org`).
